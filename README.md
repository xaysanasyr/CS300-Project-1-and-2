# CS300-Project-1-and-2

For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit your analysis of the run-time and memory for the data structures. From Project Two, submit the working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. Together, these documents showcase your work in data structures and algorithms.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will also help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I faced while working on project one, was understanding how the analysis of the runtime for the 3 different types of data types.

The problems that I faced while coding the data structure of choice was reading the file, a sorting function that I forgot to add, and configuring the various methods and vector class.

How did you approach the problem? How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In project one, it was confusing at first but I just set each line cost to 1 to make it morethen I realized utilizing how a file would read per line and how many times lines are repeated would get me the runtime results. I chose a vector structure because it was less than hash table and binary search tree. This is important to understand because each structure has its pros and cons, and it's all about finding the right data structure to increase the effectiveness of the project at hand.

In project two, I was trying to make my code as simple as possible but still involve the required criteria that I was provided. I wanted to have a CSV.file that was implemented into code so in the menu by choosing "1. load file" it would automatically  load the file that had the course information quickly. I couldn't quite get the load file method to work properly, so I decided to put method to input the actually file name to load up. I learned how to do this in a previous class that had a lot of c++ coding as well while working with files. The various methods and vector class took a bit of time to understand, but in this course we already worked with a vector file from earlier in the course and I just took what I needed from it and tweaked it a bit to work for my project. ( I didn't copy and paste it, but it did help me quite a bit having that file to view and learn from to add into my  own project)


How has your work on these projects expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This was the first utilizing of actually coding from a psuedocode from scratch. This helped expand my knowledge of C++ quite a bit, and how to utilizing various data structures that we learned throughout the course ( vector, hash table, binary search)


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I still need to add more comments. My code has been more maintainable because I liked to keep my code simple. I keep my code simple because I can reflect back on it later when needed. I do not do any complex functions or methods and I try to incorporate easier to read and understand comments when needed.

Overall, I am fairly happy with the outcome of my projects in this course and I can't wait to apply it in real world applications.
