# CS300-Project-1-and-2

For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit your analysis of the run-time and memory for the data structures. From Project Two, submit the working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. Together, these documents showcase your work in data structures and algorithms.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will also help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I faced while working on project one, was understanding how the analysis of the runtime for the 3 different types of data types.

The problems that I faced while coding the data structure of choice was reading the required file, a sorting function that I forgot to add, and configuring the various methods and vector class.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In project one, it was
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
